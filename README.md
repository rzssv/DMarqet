# DMarqet
Mock auction house made with ReplDB


## How to run
The Replit URL can be found here: 
https://replit.com/@rzssw/DMarqet?v=1#index.php 

Fork the project and run it in a developer URL.


## How it works
1. Create an account/Log in
2. Sell an item in the 'sell' tab
    1. The people who are buying must know the seller in real life, so that you may give the money/item
    2. Each item will be on sale for 10 minutes
    3. You cannot sell an item while another one is already being sold
3. Another person places a bid in the 'bid' tab
    1. The bid must be higher than the current bid/starting price
    2. You cannot bid on your own item
4. Once the 10 minutes are up, the person who has the highest bid will recieve it in their 'account' tab, where they can show the seller and do the transaction
5. The winner of the last auction will show up on the 'buy' tab while nothing is being sold, making easier access for the seller
