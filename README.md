Fork the project and run it in a developer URL.

## How it works
1. Create an account
2. Sell an item in the 'sell' tab
  2. The people who are buying must know the seller in real life, so that you may give the money/item
  3. Each item will be on sale for 10 minutes
  4. You cannot sell an item while another one is already being sold
5. Another person places a bid in the 'bid' tab
6.
